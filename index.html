      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The Poles is a South Korean indie band that debuted on September 8, 2017 with their first EP, From the Outset. Since their debut, they’ve been loved for their indie modern rock sound, gently mixed with soulful R&B tones and subtle rock elements, creating music that feels personal and comforting.
        The name The Poles symbolizes the “pole of the moment” the members face in life; the emotional highs and lows that come with time, growth, and change. This meaning is reflected deeply in their songs, which often feel like quiet conversations and late-night thoughts.
        The members first met at church, where a shared bond naturally grew into the formation of the band. Daniel Kim, the front person and main songwriter, leads the group with honest storytelling and emotion-filled melodies. Lee Hwangje plays an important role in shaping the band’s sound, while Kim Kyungbae holds the rhythm as the drummer. 
        Together, their chemistry is something fans truly cherish. Beyond The Poles, the members have also been involved in other musical projects, including Wave to Earth, showing their versatility and strong presence in the Korean indie scene. For many fans, The Poles are more than just a band, their music feels like a companion through different moments in life.</p>
